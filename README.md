ðŸ“š Project Overview
This repository contains a set of Postman API tests for the Trello API. The tests are designed to verify the functionality and integrity of the Trello application, ensuring that common operations such as creating, updating, and deleting boards, lists, and cards work as expected.

The collection includes test scenarios for several Trello API endpoints, including:

GET operations (retrieving boards, lists, cards, etc.)

POST operations (creating new boards, cards, etc.)

PUT/PATCH operations (updating boards, lists, and cards)

DELETE operations (removing boards, lists, and cards)
The tests also incorporate environment variables to facilitate dynamic execution in different environments (e.g., production, development, etc.). These variables make the tests adaptable and reusable.

Creating and Updating Boards:
